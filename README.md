# Space-cowboys-travel
A website that displays the weather and local events for any searched city.

# Description
This website takes in user input through the search bar and uses that data to search two different APIS and return that data to the screen. The first api is the weather API which returns a 6 day forecast and the current date. It also displays an icon. The second api compares the search bar input to a massive JS object and checks to see if one of the city values is true, and then searches ticketmaster API and returns 6 events as long as they are not repeats. 
Searched cities present the user with a "star" which they can use to save that city into local storage and view later. This function also has a reset button to clear said cities. This site was built using Fomantic-UI as the wireframe, and css to tweak colors, font sizes, etc.
